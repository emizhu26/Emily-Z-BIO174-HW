        <h1>Human Evolution</h1>

        <p id="first">Have you ever wondered how humans have evolved over time? This site offers an introductory, broad overview of human evolution. Much of
            our knowledge about evolution comes from evidence found by paleoanthropologists, who study and identify features of human fossils.
            We will highlight notable ancestors, major species and developments, and other evolutionary trends and findings.</p>
        
        <h2>Who was Lucy?</h2>
        <img src="lucy.jpeg" alt="Lucy's fossils"/>
        <ol>
            <li>Discovered in 1974 in Ethipia by paleoanthropologists Donald Johanson and Tom Gray, Lucy was a skeleton of the hominin species 
                <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>. </li>
            <li>Her bones date to 3.2 million years ago</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scientists recovered around 40% of her entire skeleton</li>
                    <li>She stood around 1.1m tall</li>
                    <li>Parts of her anatomy suggest that she stood upright/walked bipedal</li>
                    <li>Scientists believe she was somewhere in between the early apelike ancestors and the Homo genus species</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <h2>Homo habilus, Homo erectus, and Neanderthals</h2>
        <p> The <i>Homo</i> genus is that includes our modern human species, the <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Before <i>Homo sapiens</i>,
            there were other significant species along the way that resemble our modern day human.

        <ol>
            <li> <i>Homo habilus</i>
                <p>
                    <i>Homo habilus</i>, which means "handy man," inhabited East Africa around 2.3 to 1.4 million years ago. 
                    Recognized as one of the earliest members of the Homo genus, <i>Homo habilus</i> displayed a significant leap in tool use. 
                    These early humans crafted and used simple stone tools, marking a crucial milestone in our evolutionary journey. 
                    Their ability to manipulate their environment paved the way for future technological advancements and demonstrated an adaptive advantage 
                    in early human development.
                </p>
            </li>
        
            <li> <i>Homo erectus</i>
                <p>
                    <i>Homo erectus</i>, a species that emerged around 1.9 million years ago, represents a major evolutionary step in the human timeline. 
                    With a more erect posture and larger brain capacity than its predecessors, <i>Homo erectus</i> expanded beyond Africa and migrated into different 
                    regions of Asia and Europe. Mastering the use of fire and creating more advanced tools, <i>Homo erectus</i> displayed enhanced adaptability, 
                    marking a significant chapter in human evolution. This species persisted for nearly 1.5 million years, leaving an enduring imprint on the 
                    story of our ancestors.
                </p>
            </li>
        
            <li> <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>
                <p>
                    <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>, otherwise known as Neanderthals, a distinct human species, thrived in Europe and parts of Asia from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago. 
                    Recognized for their robust physique and unique adaptations to cold climates, <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i> were skilled hunters and toolmakers. 
                    Recent genetic studies reveal interbreeding between <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i> and <i>Homo sapiens</i>>, suggesting a shared ancestry. 
                    <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i> possessed symbolic expression, buried their dead, and demonstrated a level of cultural sophistication. Despite their extinction, 
                    the legacy of Neanderthals lives on in the genetic makeup of modern humans, revealing the interconnectedness of our evolutionary paths.

        <h2>Major Developments and Milestones in Human Evolution</h2>
        <p>These developments and inventions were major turning points that highlighting our ability to adapt,
            thrive, and diversify our species across millenia.
        </p>
        <h3>Bipedalism</h3>
        <p>The adoption of upright walking, or bipedalism, was a crucial adaptation that freed the hands for tool use and marked a significant 
            departure from our ape ancestors.</p>

        <h3>Tool Use and Technology</h3>
        <p>The development and improvement of tools, starting with simple stone tools crafted by early hominids like Homo habilis, allowed for 
            greater control over the environment and enhanced survival skills.</p>

        <h3>Expansion out of Africa</h3>
        <p><i>Homo erectus's</i> migration out of Africa, approximately 1.9 million years ago, marked a key moment in human evolution, 
            as our ancestors ventured into new territories, adapting to diverse environments.</p>

        <h3>Fire Control</h3>
        <p><i>Homo erectus</i> is associated with the mastery of fire, which provided warmth, protection, and facilitated cooking. This technological 
            advancement influenced social behaviors and dietary patterns.</p>

        <h3>Enlarged Brain Size</h3>
        <p>Over time, there was a gradual increase in brain size, particularly evident in later species like <i>Homo sapiens</i>. This expansion is 
            linked to advanced cognitive abilities, including language and complex problem-solving.</p>
